Create a python program that will utilize a while loop that accepts a user password.
- If correct it will print out welcome {user name} and if wrong printout 'wrong password! You have tried and failed X# of Times!'
- Then keep waiting till user types right password.
- The while loop will count how many attempts have been made
- If there have been 3 failed attempts then let the user know and quit the application.
- Password = 'password'
